# dice

This is a simple dice service written in Python.

When you load the page it randomly rolls a dice and shows you the dice
roll.

## Install

Nothing fancy, just run it.  Have to install something first, though...

```
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 dice
```

Send your browser to `localhost:8080` and press reload each time you
want a dice throw.

## TODO

The author has never seen a dice before.  I tried to explain it over the
phone.  Works for now.
